## Asymptotic Analysis

- Asymptotic Analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of input size and it's increase.

- Using asymptotic analysis we dpn't measure actual running time of algorithm.

- It helps in determining how time and space taken by algorithm increases with input size.
